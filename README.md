# netlib-src [![Version][version-img]][version-url] [![Status][status-img]][status-url]

The package provides [BLAS][1] and [LAPACK][2] using the [Netlib][3]
implementation. By default, the package will build and use a bundled Netlib,
which requires a Fortran and C compiler.

The following Cargo features are supported:

* `cblas` to build CBLAS (enabled by default),
* `lapacke` to build LAPACKE (enabled by default),
* `tmg` to build TESTING/MATGEN routines (enabled by default),
* `static` to link to Netlib statically, and
* `system` to skip building the bundled Netlib.

## Where are all the FFI definitions?

This package provides only an implementation of BLAS and LAPACK. Bindings are
available in [blas-sys][4] and [lapack-sys][5], and wrappers are available in
[blas][6] and [lapack][7].
